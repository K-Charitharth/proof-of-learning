**Proof of Learning**

decentralized learning credential system that issues soulbound NFT certificates to real, verified humans. Learn, prove you're human, pass a course — and earn a permanent, portable proof of achievement.

🔍 Problem it Solves
🎭 No Identity Verification – Online platforms don’t verify if a real person completed the course.

🧟‍♂️ Bot Exploits – Fake accounts abuse learning rewards and certificates.

🪪 Lack of Credential Ownership – Learners don’t own their credentials.

🧾 Employers Can’t Verify Authenticity – There's no trusted source of truth for credentials.
